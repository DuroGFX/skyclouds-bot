If you would like to add a new embed to the bot,  click "New File" and type "commands/(YOURCMD).js"
Then, paste this format:


const Discord = require("discord.js");
const colors = require("../colors");
const botconfig = require("../botconfig")

module.exports.run = async (bot, message, args) => {
  let EXAMPLEEMBED = new Discord.RichEmbed()
        .setColor(colors.blue)
        .setTitle("Whatever")
        .addField("**Server Owner**", `${message.guild.owner}`, false)
        .addField("**Member Count**", `${message.guild.memberCount}`, false)
        .addField("**Bot Count**", `${message.guild.roles.get("687498488295981069").members.size}`, false)
        .addField("**Need Help?**", `Do **>help** for a list of commands!`, false)
        .setFooter(`skyclouds ip whenever`, bot.user.displayAvatarURL);
        message.channel.send({embed: EXAMPLEEMBED});
  };

module.exports.help = {
  name: "YOURCMD"
};


✵ Make sure that the spacing and everything is consistant to the 
✵ Make sure you update the name (name: "YOURCMD") to the command you want.
✵ Make sure to change "EXAMPLEEMBED" to the name of the embed, for example, HelloEmbed!
  ✵ This applies to both "message.channel.send" and also "let HelpEmbed"

- setColor is the colors! (Hard to tell, I know) You can find the list of colors in "colors.json" and to change the color simply change ".setColor(colors.yellow)" to something like ".setColor(colors.pink)"!
- setTitle is the title of the embed! It's the big text at the top aka the title... You can change the "Advancius Help" To something such as "Hello World!"
- addField is the actual things inside of the embed. The first string is the title, so you can change it to "**Hello**" and it will have Hello as the title, you can also add as many as you want!
- setFooter you'd just leave it alone. It's basically the end of the embed that has the logo and says the IP
- You can also add placeholders (such as ${message.guild.owner})

✵ If you need any more help you can DM Duro#5232 on Discord!
